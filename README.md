# LSTM-program-synthesis
This is just a rough LSTM implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09627.pdf  https://github.com/ellisk42/TikZ in Clojure.

Wanted to get a feel for Clojure as well as [Sketch program synthesizer](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/).

The Clojure LSTM library is [flare](http://aria42.com/flare/).
